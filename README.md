# Simulation
Repo for Mini Project-2

 Simulator is a basic java program to visualize Red-Black trees from DS Concepts for teaching purposes,
 created using Java and Java GUI components.
 
<h3><b>Binary Trees</b> - </h3> 
 <p>A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.</p>
 
 <h3><b>Binary Search Trees</b> - </h3> 
 <pre>Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
<ul>
<l1>The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.</l1>
<l1>The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.</l1>
<l1>The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.</l1>
</ul></pre>
 
<h3><b>Red-Black trees</b> - </h3> 
<pre>
Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where every node follows following rules.
1) Every node has a color either red or black.
2) Root of tree is always black.
3) There are no two adjacent red nodes (A red node cannot have a red parent or red child).
4) Every path from a node (including root) to any of its descendant NULL node has the same number of black nodes.</pre>
